    "description": "opening_hours tag is used in OpenStreetMap project to describe time ranges when a specific facility (for example, a cafe) is open. As it has pretty complex syntax which require special parsing and additional processing to extract some useful information (e.g. whether a facility is open at specific time, next time it's going to open/close, or a readable set of working hours), this library was written.",
